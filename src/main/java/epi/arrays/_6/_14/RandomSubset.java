/**
 * Question:
 * Write a program that takes as input a positive integer n and a size k < n, and returns
 * a size-k subset of {0,1,2,...,n-1}. The subset should be represented as an array. All
 * subsets should be equally likely and, in addition, all permutations of elements of the
 * array should be equally likely. You may assume you have a function which takes as input
 * a non-negative integer t and returns an integer in the set {0,1,...,t-1} with uniform probability.
