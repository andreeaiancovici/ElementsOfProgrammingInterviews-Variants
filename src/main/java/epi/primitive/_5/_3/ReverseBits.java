/**
 * Question:
 * Write a program that takes a 64-bit word and returns the 64-bit word consisting of
 * the bits of the input word in reverse order.
 * ---
 * Memo:
 * OR trick: You can compute bit sub-parts of a number and then combine them using OR operator.
 * ---
 * Solution:
 * Brute-force: Reverse the first 32 bits with their counterparts.
 * For repeatedly performed operation, we can use a look-up table (CACHE).
 * In our case, we chose to have a look-up table containing all reversed mappings for 16-bit numbers.
 * We will split our 64-bit number into 4 sections of 16 bits.
 * TO-DO:
 * Why did we choose 16-bit CACHE?
 * An array size is defined by an integer, which in Java can have a maximum size of 2^31âˆ’1.
 * Therefore we cannot define a CACHE for 32-bit numbers.
 * ---
 * Time Complexity for computing CACHE (one time): O(2^16) = 65536
 * Time Complexity: O(n/L) - L is size of cache; repeatedly performed operation
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
